# the Kast Glossary

Since Kast is a Kubernetes Arcane Spelling Technology, it uses its own typos to define different parts of the complete Kast Bookshelf, This glossary is here to define them.

## FAQ

### Do i need to read this to use Kast?

Not necesarily but, if you want to understand what every keyword means and not just guess, this is the way to start undrstanding how to make your own Kast Bookshelf

### Why using strange language for a tool intended to be simplistic and uncomplicated?

If you are in the Kubernetes Bussinesi (and programming in general) you already know that a big issue is how we name things, and specially kubernetes carries a lot of terms that drive to confusion, an example, since kubernetes is mainly used to deploy *micro services*, usually the word *service* is usefull to refer to one, but that already a reserved word in Kubernetes resources! so its prone to confusion, this also happen with concepts like Apps, Gateways, Ingress, etc. so, using magic-like language we avoid that issue, there is a lot of CDR out there, but surely non is called "Rune" or "Kaster".

Also, since Kast *Renders* infrastructure, common names could override valid user defined keys and values with specific Kast typos, you may have lot of values with different names defined in your charts but probably "Glyph" is not one of those. 

### Why magic and not Naval Slang like other Kubernetes tools like Helm, Istio, Argo...

Most people say Kubernetes is magic, well, lets do Magic!
