# the Kaster Handbook

As part of it's standarized solutions kast provides since its second version a Kaster, which is a kind of package manager that allows you to build complex infrastructure in simple configurations via Glyphs and the Lexicon, in this book we explain straight forward how to implement specific Glyphs on your infrastructure via Kast.

> This are not the only glyphs there are, there are many more, but this still a WIP Documentation.
