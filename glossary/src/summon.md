# WIP, not updated to current summon behaviour

A summon is other of the kast main features, a summon is a template similar to a Kaster but with the following rules:

- Only allow Kubernetes and ArgoCD default resourses
- Its oriented to independent Containers.

So imagine you want to add to your cluster a container that doesnt have a helmchart, or the helmchart is not setup for your specific usage, you can setup a summon template that is a set of default kubernetes resources to make a chart that suits your needs with no effort.
